<p>Dear {{speaker__firstname}},</p>

<p>We thank you for your patience. We have been working hard to schedule our first fully virtual ICLR over the past few weeks, and we are finally ready to provide you with access and schedule information.</p>

<p>1. Web portal</p>

<p>You will find all the information about the conference on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445136000">https://iclr.cc/virtual/</a>. You should be registered and logged in, in order to access the web portal. As the author of a contributed paper at the conference, we would like to draw your attention to the following pages in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schedule: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/calendar.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445137000">https://iclr.cc/virtual/calendar.html</a>&nbsp;this page lists all the sessions of the conference.</li>
<li>Papers: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/papers.html?filter%3Dauthors&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445137000">https://iclr.cc/virtual/papers.html?filter=authors</a>&nbsp;this page allows you to find your own papers. If you see any problem with your own paper(s) on this page, please report to us at <a href="mailto:iclr2020-virtual@googlegroups.com">iclr2020-virtual@googlegroups.com</a>&nbsp;or at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.rocket.chat/channel/tech-support&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445138000">#tech-support</a>.</li>
<li>Help: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/about.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445138000">https://iclr.cc/virtual/about.html</a>&nbsp;this is where you will find the answer to any question you may have during the conference and particularly during your own presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Rocket.Chat</p>

<p>We will use Rocket.Chat for asynchronous interaction between authors and participants. You were automatically registered in the ICLR Rocket.Chat using your email address (at the address you received this email). Please go to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.rocket.chat/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445139000">https://iclr.rocket.chat/</a>&nbsp;to reset your password and join the other participants. </p>

<p>You can access the ICLR Rocket.Chat by either typing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.rocket.chat/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445139000">https://iclr.rocket.chat/</a>&nbsp;in your browser&rsquo;s address bar or by going to Chat in the ICLR Web Portal (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/chat.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445139000">https://iclr.cc/virtual/chat.html</a>). We have pre-populated the following channels dedicated to your papers:</p>

<p>[Paper ID] [Paper Title] [Rocket.Chat channel]</p>
<p>[Paper ID] [Paper Title] [Rocket.Chat channel]</p>

<p>3. Zoom</p>

<p>We will Zoom extensively for you to interact with conference participants. Each paper of yours will be assigned a dedicated zoom meeting room, and we ask you to be present in the meeting room during the following slots which were selected by yourself or chosen randomly if you did not participate in the preference survey earlier:</p>

<p>[Paper ID] {Slot 1}, {Slot 2}, {Zoom URL}</p>

<p>[Paper ID] {Slot 1}, {Slot 2}, {Zoom URL}</p>

<ul>
<li>Update your zoom client to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting the zoom meeting as host for your poster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log completely out of zoom in one of your browsers and login in using the supplied credentials. In that browser, log in using {{host_zoom_user_email}} and dotDevRandom8 . In that same browser click this {{start_link}}.</li>
<li>If you are already a zoom user and your zoom application is signed in, there is no need to log out of your regular account. Only the web browser that opens the start_link needs to be logged into the account provided above.</li>
<li>Verify that you&rsquo;re in the correct zoom meeting room by clicking the (i) in the zoom toolbar (or at the top left of the screen for attendees). You should see the title of your paper. </li>
<li>As host, you have the ability to start the meeting, kick people out (available in the participants list as &lsquo;remove&rsquo;). You may designate someone else to be host and you may reclaim host. You may allow a participant to share their screen, although we discourage this unless you know the person.</li>
<li>Your co-authors should join the meeting using the join_link. If they also &ldquo;start&rdquo; the meeting and you are already the host, you will be kicked out of the meeting. Only one person should start and host the meeting. If someone needs to take over host duties, then the first host should make them host using the participants list in-meeting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ending the meeting</p>
<ul>
<li>When a host leaves the meeting, they have the option to End Meeting For All, or to Leave the Meeting. If the host leaves the meeting while attendees are still in the meeting, one of the remaining attendees will assume the role of host at random. We recommend having the host stay in the meeting until it finishes and then ending the meeting for all. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other considerations </p>
<ul>
<li>All participants are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445143000">code of conduct</a>. If someone needs to be kicked from your meeting, use &ldquo;remove&rdquo; in the Participants List under the &ldquo;more&hellip;&rdquo; button when you hover over their name. If you would like to report someone to ICLR for misbehavior, the code of conduct has a section on reporting. </li>
<li>You may start this meeting before it's scheduled time to practice. You may also start the meeting again after it's end date. Use the start instructions to start the meeting again.</li>
<li>We discourage recording of videos. We found that in some of our testing, recording the meeting reduced the streaming quality. If you start recording, we advise mentioning that at the start of your presentation. Attendees may tell if a zoom session is being recorded by the icon in the upper left of the zoom screen. Do not post such a recording online without written consent from everyone who appeared or spoke in your recorded session. </li>
<li>SlidesLive is not live-streaming your poster zoom meeting. </li>
<li>In the main zoom client interface, you may activate a clock that shows how long your meeting has been active. https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115002542683-Show-My-Connected-Time-in-a-Meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>You are the host of the Zoom meeting room and have the highest level of privilege. Please do not share the Zoom URL above with anyone other than your co-authors. Participants will receive a separate join URLs for each paper, one for each presentation. </p>

<p>Only one person should use the Zoom URL above to start the zoom meeting. </p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iclr.cc/virtual/about.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445144000">FAQ</a>&nbsp;in the ICLR Web Portal for more info.</p>

<p>Please so take our quick survey. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNjlOB25roV2nG7rYQWCX9uGazkj83IC9UwHhiSI8FVFDavQ/viewform&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587529445144000">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNjlOB25roV2nG7rYQWCX9uGazkj83IC9UwHhiSI8FVFDavQ/viewform</a></p>

<p>Stay healthy, and we look forward to having you in our virtual ICLR&rsquo;20 next week!</p>
